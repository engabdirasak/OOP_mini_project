Object-Oriented Programming Mini-Project
Objective:
This mini-project aims to enhance my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through practical implementation. By working on this project, I intend to solidify my knowledge of OOP concepts, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Project Overview:
The mini-project will involve creating a simple application with multiple classes that interact with each other to perform specific tasks. Each class will represent real-world entities, allowing me to apply OOP principles effectively.

Key Focus Areas:
Encapsulation: Properly encapsulating class members to control access and protect data integrity.
Inheritance: Utilizing inheritance to establish relationships and hierarchies between classes.
Polymorphism: Implementing polymorphic behavior through method overriding or interfaces.
Abstraction: Abstracting away complexities to create clean and understandable class structures.
Example Project:
Creating a banking application could be an ideal mini-project. This application might involve classes like Account, SavingsAccount, CurrentAccount, and Transaction, each encapsulating relevant data and functionalities. Inheritance could be utilized between Account and specialized account types. Polymorphism might be applied in transaction processing methods.

Learning Goals:
Gain proficiency in designing and implementing classes following OOP principles.
Develop cleaner, modular, and maintainable code using OOP paradigms.
Improve problem-solving skills by structuring the project around real-world scenarios.
Implementation Plan:
Class Design: Plan and design classes with a clear understanding of their attributes and behaviors.
Code Implementation: Write classes in a programming language of choice, ensuring adherence to OOP principles.
Testing and Refinement: Test the application extensively, identify areas for improvement, and refine the codebase iteratively.
Documentation: Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation explaining class relationships, methods, and functionalities.
Conclusion:
This mini-project serves as an invaluable opportunity to reinforce OOP concepts practically. By developing a well-structured and functional application, I aim to enhance my proficiency in utilizing OOP principles effectively in software development.
